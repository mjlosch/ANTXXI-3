layers for which mean stream function (units 1000 m^2/s, NOT
integrated) is representative:
layer 1: 19m-50m   ! contaminated by intertial oscillations etc.
layer 2: 50m-100m
layer 3: 100m-150m
layer 4: 150m-200m ! Boris takes this as representative for mean flow
layer 5: 200m-250m

format of continuous ADCP data eifex_all_uv.mat
uv = 79 depth layers x (u,v)*number of horiontal points
units = m/s
Volker Strass: everything above 100m is heavily contaminated by
intertial oscillations and other noise, not recommended for assimilation

format of continuous ADCP data eifex_all_xy.mat
xyt = (lon lat julian_days) x number of horizontal points
z   = depth between measuments (m)
zc  = depth at measurments (m)
