Hi Volker,

Greetings from the Arctic! I am writing this whilst coming to the end of
yet another cruise this year but this time we are in the ice and it has
been very pleasant! This emAil will be sent on my return.

Here are all the profiles from the cruise. I guess they are self
explanatory but you can always come back to me with some questions.

I will be taking a short break after the cruise but am back at work 9th
August

I hope that I get the chance to be part of the writing of your paper and
not just get an authorship for providing the CT data! So please feel
free to send drafts and not just the nearly-end product.

I hope we can also soon arrange my visit to the AWI next spring to work
on the 16/3, EISENEX and EIFEX papers.

cheers

Richard
