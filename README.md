# ANTXXI-3
EIFEX model revival, eventually will contain all data to run MITgcm simulations

So far this repository contains the collection of data obtained during the EIFEX cruise in 2004 (ANTXXI-3). This data has been used to set up and constrain an regional ocean model with open boundary conditions with adjoint methods with results documented in [Losch et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmarsys.2013.09.003).

We intend to reconstruct the model simulations from these data sources.
